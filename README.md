## Contributing

When gathering data, make an effort to only use sources that are either from within the industry itself or are from an unbiased third-party. Pro-vegan websites should be avoided when sourcing information.

Some good sources:

 * [USDA Economics, Statistics and Market Information System](http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/homepage.do) (the [NASS](http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/browseAgency.do?agency=nass) reports in particular)
 * [FAOSTAT](http://faostat.fao.org) for world-wide data (use [Download Data](http://faostat3.fao.org/download/Q/QL/E) or [the classic site](http://faostat.fao.org/site/569/default.aspx#ancor))
